1. Analysis

The MVP of the Wanderlust WebApp successfully meets several of its primary objectives.The platform features user authentication with role-based access, ensuring different permissions for visitors, guides, and administrators. Destination and guide management functionalities allow users to explore Burundi's tourism offerings efficiently. The implementation of a booking system enables users to schedule tours with guides, although the payment feature is not yet fully integrated. Additionally, the rating system fosters user engagement by allowing reviews for guides and destinations. The admin and guide dashboards streamline the management of users, bookings, and destinations, improving the platform’s overall usability.

Despite these achievements, challenges arose during testing. Initially, there were issues with role-based access restrictions, which were later resolved. The payment system, though planned, remains incomplete due to technical limitations. Another challenge observed was the website’s performance, as it occasionally experienced slow loading times, particularly on low-spec devices. Optimization efforts are necessary to improve speed and responsiveness for a seamless user experience.

Performance testing across different devices revealed that the platform runs well on modern browsers but suffers from occasional lag, especially on lower-end hardware. To enhance performance, further optimizations such as caching strategies, code minimization, and efficient API handling should be considered.

2. Discussion

Each milestone in this project played a crucial role in shaping the final product. Implementing authentication and role-based access was essential to ensure secure and structured interactions between different types of users. The rating system and guide management functionalities contribute to user trust and engagement, making it easier for tourists to choose reliable guides and destinations. The booking system streamlines travel planning, simplifying the process of connecting users with local tour guides, which ultimately supports Burundi’s tourism industry.

Although the payment feature remains incomplete, the existing infrastructure lays the groundwork for future financial transactions, which will enhance the platform’s usability and business potential. Addressing performance concerns will be vital in ensuring a smooth experience for all users, regardless of their device specifications.

Looking ahead, several improvements can be made to enhance the platform. Completing the admin dashboard with reporting functionalities will provide better insights into bookings, ratings, and user activities. Performance optimization should be prioritized to improve load times and responsiveness. Additionally, integrating a secure payment system will enable users to finalize their tour bookings seamlessly.

By addressing these areas, the platform can evolve beyond its MVP stage into a comprehensive and user-friendly tourism solution that benefits both visitors and local businesses.
